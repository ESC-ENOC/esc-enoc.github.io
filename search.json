This working group fosters and encourages all practices that embrace openness, integrity and reproducibility throughout the research cycle, including the collaborative working and sharing of research methodology, use and development of open access software, making analytic code and research equipment freely available online, and publishing research outputs (e.g., articles, books, data, peer reviews, software) in open access – so anyone, from any part of the world, can view and download them without the need to log in or pay.\nIt is pressing for criminology to promote the open science principles. ‘Open criminology’ describes the set of practices that embrace openness, integrity and reproducibility throughout the cycle of researching the causes, consequences, prevention, control and treatment of crime and delinquency, offenders and victims, and the practice of criminal law, law enforcement, and judicial and correctional systems."

    "title": "Advancing the Standard Model of Publishing – Registered Reports",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Publishing research in peer-reviewed journals typically looks like this: a study is designed, data is collected, the results are (perhaps several years after data collection) written up, and the article is then submitted to a journal. This ‘standard model’ of publishing feels familiar, and it might be hard to imagine alternatives. However, there are (at least) two disadvantages.\nFirst, researchers might invest considerable resources to conduct high-quality studies that are not accepted for publication because of their nil results (see Crow et al., 2023 for an analysis of the (low) prevalence of nil results published in leading criminology and criminal justice journals). Data ends up in the proverbial file drawer and the publication bias in the respective domain is further enhanced.\nA second disadvantage of the ‘standard model’ of publishing is that it affords researchers infinite opportunities, or degrees of freedom, to curate the data analysis as well as the presentation of results to attain a compelling narrative. Hypotheses might be revised after key results have been identified (i.e., HARKing); analyses might be repeated with different tests, covariates, or outcomes until significant findings are detected; experimental conditions might be dropped or combined to avoid nil findings (i.e., p-hacking). In the submitted paper, neither of these so-called questionable research practices (QRPs) can be easily spotted. However, QRPs increase the rate of false positives, in other words, the probability that identified effects are not true effects. False positives are unlikely to be replicated and skew the empirical evidence base.\nIn recent years, a new article format – registered reports – has gained popularity; it promises to address concerns about inflated publication biases and the risk of publishing false positive findings. A key difference between the ‘standard model’ of publishing and the registered report format is that authors receive peer-review feedback before and after data collection (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n“Figure 1. Registered Report Process. Source: https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports”\n\n\nMore precisely, authors submit, initially, a so-called Stage 1 submission. The latter includes three main parts. First, the literature review, study rationale, and hypotheses are presented; these sections resemble those in a ‘standard model’ article. Second, the study design is defined in a Methods section, including, depending on the chosen methodology, the specification of variables and measures, data exclusion criteria, sample characteristics, and/or data collection methods. Third, the planned analysis steps are discussed in detail, referring to data pre-processing and hypotheses tests. The study design and analysis plans are written in future tense. If applicable, completed pilot studies can be presented as well. No data for the main study is or has been collected at this point. Stage 1 submissions may be rejected, accepted, or reviewers may request changes to, for instance, the planned sample size or measures.\nOnce the Stage 1 submission has been accepted (i.e., in-principle acceptance), authors can collect data in line with the accepted plan. Importantly, if authors do comply with the registered study design and analysis plan, they are guaranteed that their full paper (i.e., Stage 2 submissions) will be accepted for publication, regardless of the results. That is, nil results have the same chance of being published as statistically significant findings. In the Stage 2 submission, the sections that were submitted in Stage 1 are only minimally altered: the Method section will be revised to apply past instead of future tense and the analysis plan may be removed. Results are presented by distinguishing confirmatory and exploratory analyses. The former refer to hypotheses tests and analyses that were confirmed in the Stage 1 submission; the latter include all additional analyses that might seem relevant once confirmatory analyses have been completed.\nAn overview of journals that offer registered reports is available here. For criminologists, the journals Law and Human Behavior as well as Legal and Criminological Psychology may be of interest. Each journal specifies the precise elements that they expect to be included in a Stage 1 and Stage 2 submission. Typically, ethics approval for the planned study needs to have been granted, and funding to run the study must be confirmed in the Stage 1 submission. Authors are also likely to be asked to indicate in the cover letter a timeline in which they plan to complete the study.\n\n\n\nThe contents of this website is available for re-use under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence."

    "title": "Developing an ‘open research partnership’ with an applied and relational focus",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It seems to us that the majority of academic action taking place under the ‘open research’ banner relates to data and publishing: open access, open peer review processes, registered reports, and open publishing of datasets for reuse.\nGiven the overwhelming focus on these activities, we were surprised to note UNESCO’s definition of open research – adopted here in Ireland and by other countries – includes three distinct pillars. For the first, to ‘make multilingual scientific knowledge openly available, accessible and reusable for everyone’, open access to academic work is clearly essential.\nA second pillar is to ‘increase scientific collaborations and sharing of information for the benefits of science and society’, while the third is to ‘open the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication to societal actors beyond the traditional scientific community’. In order to achieve these goals, researchers must think beyond how to ‘open up’ the work we will do anyway – data collection, analysis and academic publication – and towards those aspects of our roles that we often forget or find more difficult – research translation, engagement with policy and practice, and public science communication. It is from these activities that we might achieve the goals of ensuring our work benefits society and making our research processes more inclusive.\nWith funding from the National Open Research Forum (NORF) in Ireland, we recently established the Criminal justice Open Research Dialogue (CORD) Partnership. The CORD Partnership is a key part of a project that aims to embed a culture of interdisciplinary open research in criminal justice in Ireland. This is not about the proliferation of research for its own sake, as important as that may be, but about ensuring that policy and practice implements existing research knowledge, and that academics understand how best to engage in research translation. The reality is that Ireland, like most countries, still has a criminal justice system that causes huge amounts of harm and fails to meet people’s needs. We have plenty of research and practice knowledge already to demonstrate how we can change this, on which we’ve yet to act. More research benefits society, but using open research ideals to help society does not always require new research to be conducted.\nOver three workshops in 2024, the CORD Partnership brought together partners from right across the research, criminal justice and community sectors to design CORD’s principles, purposes and priorities. This will imminently be published as an (open access!) article, with 58 authors from 32 organisations – many of which do not have a long history of putting their officials’ names to public statements relating to research collaboration. We will also publish an agenda for the years 2025-26, listing the actions on which researchers, policymakers and practitioners will collaborate. The CORD Partnership includes 119 people from 53 organisations in research, justice policy, practice and oversight, non-state justice services, civil society and research infrastructure.\nWhile criminal justice research is burgeoning in Ireland (albeit, from a low starting point), we have seen an unprecedented level of collaboration in the past year to get the CORD Partnership to this point. We also undertook a scoping review to explore criminal justice research partnerships, and to work out what ‘makes them tick’. We found that successful partnerships built positive, trusting relationships, agreed clear governance and communication structures, and encouraged partners to share resources, spend time in each other’s worlds, learn from each other, and develop shared priorities. We concluded that research partnerships should seek to facilitate dialogue that builds understanding among partners, and to co-create opportunities for research translation that make sense in the local context. This makes the research partnership ‘open’ because its applied nature ensures research benefits society and involves partners outside of research as equals.\nSo, what did we do to build this coalition? If you organise or attend lots of events, you’ll know how hard it is to get people into the room in the first place, never mind to do something that makes the most of the time spent together and demonstrates tangible progress was made. In their article on researcher-practitioner partnerships, Tillyer et al. (2014: 415) contend (emphasis added):\nSuccess is predicated on at least three sources of influence: the researcher, the practitioner, and the process by which they interact. […] The partnership process needs to identify achievable goals, encourage and develop trust between the partners, ensure effective data collection, and promote communication of results across venues that benefit researchers and practitioners.\nTo maximise the value of our interactions, we combined our learning from the fields of restorative practices and design thinking. The former provides the language and tools that can help facilitate equitable, inclusive dialogue and build relationships in group settings. In our case, we used circle processes to ensure that everyone had a chance to speak in each group and time was invested in relationships to set a positive social climate before the tasks began. The latter, a complementary framework and set of principles and skills, was used to help us empathise with the people whom were the beneficiaries of our work and to be creative in coming up with new ideas for actions. This culminated in our latest design workshop, where we came up with problem statements and ideas – underpinned by the principles, purposes and priorities we established through restorative circle work at an earlier workshop – from which we are creating an action plan for the next two years.\nThese are not resource-neutral activities: they take time and, ideally, dedicated human resources to organise and coordinate. In our case, we also benefited from having built positive relationships and trust with many partners over years on which we could draw. But they also require little in the way of financial expenditure (sandwiches, aside) – it is through investing time and energy that this kind of collaborative work can help embed a culture of open research in a sector.\nThe potential value of dialogue and co-creation in partnership working is that these are processes – not outcomes. It is not prescriptive to hypothesise that restorative and design approaches could support open research partnership development in other countries, contexts and policy themes. Indeed, these approaches enable diverse groups to situate their discussions, planning and ideas in their own contexts and establish a joint vision to whatever extent is appropriate and possible.\nOur next steps include to evaluate our approach and publish our model so that others can explore the extent to which our experience may be replicable. In the meantime, we’ll ensure our partners are offered an opportunity to connect on a human level and participate meaningfully in decision-making and action, to sustain their commitment to open research.\n\n\n\nThe contents of this website is available for re-use under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology of the University of Cologne, in collaboration with the European Network for Open Criminology (ENOC), and funding from the ECONtribute cluster, organises the workshop titled Open Science and Open Data in European Criminological Research.\nDate: 24-25 September 2024\nLocation: Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology, University of Cologne, Room S.242 Universitätsstr. 24 50937 Cologne, Germany\nCriminological research is crucial for informing public policies and the practices of law enforcement and criminal justice. However, several issues, such as the lack of replicability1, limited accessibility of results2, and concerns about questionable practices within the field1, among others, may undermine confidence in the discipline. While related behavioural sciences, such as psychology, have made strides towards more transparent and reproducible science, criminology lags far behind. In this context, some scholars have highlighted these issues and advocated for a shift towards Open Science (OS) in criminology1.\nThe principles of OS, namely quality, integrity, collective benefit, equity, fairness, diversity, and inclusiveness4, (should) align with the values of most criminology researchers. Nonetheless, the implementation of these values in criminological research is not without controversy. For instance, the concept of open data presents a dilemma. Making data publicly available can enhance the replicability of results and their reliability through public scrutiny, as well as contribute to the theoretical development of criminology. Concretely, allowing researchers from diverse backgrounds and perspectives to access a given data set enables them to test existing theories or generate new hypotheses. However, much criminological data is sensitive, and its dissemination raises significant ethical concerns. Moreover, the time and economic costs involved often impede data sharing. Finally, care needs to be taken in order not to disincentivize efforts of primary data collection.\nIn the European context, researchers, both individually and in teams, have been gradually embracing the values of OS. In 2023, collective initiatives have emerged, such as the formation of the ENOC (European Network for Open Criminology) within the European Society of Criminology. Against this backdrop, the University of Cologne, with support from ENOC, aims to foster a debate on OS in European criminology. With financial backing from ECONtribute, we plan to organize a workshop where papers that contribute to this discussion are presented, and the current state of OS in European criminology is examined. The workshop’s aim is to gather researchers interested in criminology who compile, disseminate or use open data to address crime-related research questions, as well as those evaluating the prevalence of Open Science practices in crime research. We invite submissions from all subfields of criminology as well as other disciplines with an interest in crime research and encourage researchers at any career stage to contribute.\nWith the support from ECONtribute, we are pleased to offer an honorarium to participants who present at the workshop. The honorarium amount will vary depending on the presenter’s career stage and country of origin. It is designed to assist with travel and accommodation expenses, although it should be noted that it will not cover the entire cost of travel and accommodation. Additionally, a prize will be bestowed upon the research deemed by the scientific committee to make a significant contribution to the field of open science in Criminology.\n\nTopics of interest include:\n\nMeta-perspectives on the usage of open science principles in European criminology\nReflections about Open Science and potential concerns in Criminological Research\nBenefits & risks of sharing criminological relevant data\nOpen research & qualitative research in criminology\nOpen qualitative data\nReproducing & replicating international criminological research findings\nUsing computational methods to obtain criminologically relevant open data\nExploiting naturally occurring variations in open data sources to study causal effects\n\nThe workshop committee, as proposed Guest Editors, are in contact with the Editorial Team of the European Journal of Criminology (EJC). A selection of contributions will be chosen to collate into a proposed Special Issue on the same topic, which has been approved in principle. Should the full proposal be acceptable to the EJC, the contributors will be presented with the opportunity to submit full manuscripts of their papers to the Special Issue. The final selection of the accepted full papers for the Special Issue in the EJC will be made after a peer-reviewed process and assessment by the workshop committee as Guest Editors with oversight from the EJC Editorial Team. While the Special Issue would focus on Open Science and the usage of open data in European criminology, we also welcome submissions that relate to other parts of the world as long as they demonstrate their relevance to the wider European context.\nAbstract submission [extended] deadline: April 30, 2024\nWord limit: 300 max.\nAbstract submission form\n\n\nReferences\n1William Alex Pridemore, Matthew C.

    "title": "Public ideas for crime and criminal justice research – an open dataset from Ireland",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Dr. Ian D. Marder (Assistant Professor in Criminology, Maynooth University School of Law and Criminology), Jennifer Spain (Research Assistant in Open Criminology, Maynooth University School of Law and Criminology), Dr. Darragh McCashin (Assistant Professor in Psychology, Dublin City University School of Psychology), Dr. Orlaith Rice (Postdoctoral Research Fellow, University of Limerick), Dr. Sophie Van der Valk (Postdoctoral Research Fellow, University College Dublin) and Stephanie Vento (Research Assistant in Open Criminology, Maynooth University School of Law and Criminology)\nCreating our Future was a Government of Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland initiative that ‘provided an opportunity for everyone in Ireland to give ideas on how to make our country better for all’ by allowing the public to submit research ideas that might ‘inspire researchers to make a better future for Ireland.’\nSubtitled ‘a national conversation on research in Ireland’, Creating our Future received 18,062 online submissions (Jul-Nov 2021). All submissions were published in a searchable database in August 2022, alongside authors’ stated age ranges and counties of residence (when provided). A thematic category (e.g. ‘Politics and Policymaking’, ‘Equality, Diversity and Inclusion’, ‘Health and Social Care’, ‘Digital World’, etc.) was also assigned to each submission after ‘expert analysis was complete to facilitate public use’ (see Information on Submissions here).\nWe are partners and research assistants of the Criminal justice Open Research Dialogue (CORD) Partnership. This is a national partnership in Ireland that ‘aims to support positive social change by embedding a culture of open research in criminal justice’ (Marder et al., forthcoming). In 2024, the lead author put out a call for partners who would be interested in exploring the dataset’s crime and criminal justice submissions, resulting in our group. This was made possible through funding from the National Open Research Forum, which funds the CORD Partnership in 2023-24.\nThe first step was to put together a subset of relevant submissions. Led by the second author, this was not straightforward, as the website permits one to search multiple keywords simultaneously, but not to download a dataset based on a search.\nAs such, we started by writing a list of keywords[1] to search. This list was used to identify relevant submissions, which were extracted individually into a spreadsheet. Extracted submissions were then reviewed for their relevance to crime or criminal justice. Many submissions were deleted (for example, submissions on social justice, climate justice and homelessness that did not mention crime or criminal justice). This left us with a final dataset of 245 submissions, which we are now making openly available for reuse (downloadable on Zenodo here).\nAt a first glance, we can see that many submissions spoke about drugs and policing. However, a more sophisticated analysis is needed to consider what the submissions were saying about these and other topics. Our suspicion is that it is worth asking what these data indicate are the public’s priorities for criminal justice reform, their views on drug laws, punitiveness and policing, and their perspectives on the connections between crime and social issues, including homelessness and housing. These are all areas of great political and social importance in Ireland, and in which policy is currently in flux.\nOf course, there are limits to this dataset. We might expect the Creating our Future project to have attracted submissions from, on average, younger, more urban and educated or computer literate persons than the general population. Relatedly, it could reasonably be assumed that people with digital accessibility challenges (including those in rural areas, or those in different demographics with particular digital needs and poor access to devices) were unable or less likely to participate.\nA further broad limitation to consider is the overall size of the dataset. Given the potential reach of the campaign, coupled with the relatively long time period allowed for data collection, the final numbers still represent a very small proportion of Ireland’s population. Moreover, the dataset we produced (n = 245) is small enough that it might have been further biased by campaigning groups having circulated the project among their members. Indeed, one of us (Marder) runs a network of people interested in restorative justice, and circulated the link to the group with the suggestion to make a related submission. A cursory review of the data suggests that a campaign group relating to cannabis legalisation may have done this too, although this is purely speculation.\nThe open-ended nature of the submission page meant that submission quality varied greatly; in some cases, the meaning of the submission was not entirely clear. Additionally, media coverage on certain issues in Ireland may have affected the issues on which the submissions focused. For example, housing has been the subject of significant controversy and public protests. A Citizens’ Assembly on Drugs Use was also being discussed within the political sphere at the time.\nAll that said, various methodological approaches could be used to interrogate the dataset further, considering its inherent strengths and limitations. Indeed, this appears to be the largest dataset specifically concerning the Irish public’s attitudes towards what research on crime and criminal justice issues should be prioritised, making it valuable data that merits further consideration.\nResearchers could examine the deeper underlying meaning(s) within submissions using theory-informed reflexive thematic analysis, or apply more computational approaches to the data (such as measuring the positive and negative sentiments). Using the outcomes of such approaches and critically comparing them to literature on public attitudes to social policies could elicit important insights for how the Irish public negotiate issues of crime and criminal justice. As things stand, we have only limited research on public attitudes to criminal justice in Ireland.\nA further methodological consideration was one of participatory design and public involvement. For example, what would a random (or purposive) sample of professionals or the public interpret from the dataset? Would they reach the same conclusions as researchers?\nMore broadly it is interesting that so few submissions actually relate to crime and criminal justice, despite the political salience of the topic. In Ireland, a country once described as ‘not obsessed with crime’, and where populist punitiveness has been kept at relative bay for many years, ideas like increased sentences, zero-tolerance policing and prison expansion are playing a growing role in political rhetoric and public discourse. Yet, crime and justice did not come up explicitly among the sixteen themes that the Creating our Future project’s internal analysis identified from among the submissions. This further limits our ability to generalise from an analysis of our own dataset, but could indicate that crime is not, in fact, that high among the public’s priorities.\nWe are hopeful that publishing this dataset will enable academic, citizen and policy researchers to make use of it to learn more about Irish public attitudes on this topic.\nThis project received funding from Ireland’s National Open Research Forum under the 2023 Open Research Fund. The National Open Research Forum is funded by the Higher Education Authority, on behalf of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.\n[1]The keywords used were: Crime, Crimes, Justice, Criminal Justice, Youth Justice, Probation, Rehabilitation, Drugs, Drug Use, Drug Abuse, Prison, Prisoner, Prisoners, Policing, Gardaí, Garda, An Garda Síochána, Police, Homelessness, Human Rights, Criminals, Protection, Restorative Justice, Restorative Practice, Safety, Court System, Court, Courts, Institutionalisation, Institutions, Gender Based Violence, Abuse, Abuses, State Powers, Law, Legislation, Laws, Officers, Human Trafficking, Offence, Sentencing, Sentence, Assault, Cannabis, Weed, Heroin.\n\n\n\nThe contents of this website is available for re-use under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence."

    "text": "The European Network for Open Criminology has organised a series of activities at the upcoming EUROCRIM2024, the 24th Annual Conference of the European Society of Criminology, which will take place in Bucharest, Romania, from September 11th to September 14th.\n1. Annual Meeting of the European Network for Open Criminology\nWednesday, September 11, 3:00 to 5:00pm, Room 2.09\nThis meeting will be dedicated to discussing ENOC’s progress and activities during our first year, as well as setting objectives for this academic year. We will send the agenda with all members of ENOC before the meeting.\n2. Roundtable ‘Academic Publishing and Open Research in Criminology’\nThursday, September 12, 2:30 to 3:45pm Place: Faculty of Law, University of Bucharest, 2nd floor - Library - reading room 1\nThis roundtable brings together editors and editors-in-chief of criminology journals to explore the evolving landscape of academic publishing in criminology. As the field embraces transparency and accessibility, this forum addresses key themes crucial to fostering open research and open access practices. The roundtable will explore the pros and cons, the strengths and limitations, and the practicalities of various open research frameworks and their application in criminology. Namely, we will invite participants to share their perspectives on the following themes: (a) open data – quantitative and qualitative – and open analytic code; (b) pre-registrations, registered reports, and null findings; (c) open peer review; and (d) open access, pre-publications, and post-publications. The following editors and editors-in-chief of criminology journals will participate in this roundtable: Matthew Ashby, Editor of ‘Crime Science’; Loraine Gelsthorpe, Editor-in-Chief of ‘Criminology and Criminal Justice’; Emily Gray, Editor of ‘The British Journal of Criminology’; Ernesto Savona, Editor-in-Chief of ‘European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research’; Volkan Topalli, Editor-in-Chief of ‘Criminology’; and Kyle Treiber, Editor-in-Chief of the ‘European Journal of Criminology’. The roundtable will illuminate best practices and strategies for advancing open research and academic publishing in criminology. By fostering collaboration among editors and scholars, this forum seeks to catalyse meaningful transformations in the openness, dissemination and accessibility of criminological knowledge. This roundtable is organised by the European Network for Open Criminology.\n3. Roundtable on open research practices: pre-registration and registered reports\nFriday, September 13, 3:30 to 4:45pm, Faculty of Law, University of Bucharest, Floor: 1st floor, Room 2.10\nThis roundtable brings together researchers with experience in open research practices to provide an introduction and discuss the benefits of pre-registration and registered reports. As criminology begins to adopt more open research principles, it is important to facilitate discussion about what these practices entail and how we can best incorporate them into our own research processes. This roundtable will focus on two key practices that aim to increase transparency and enhance the quality of research methodology as well as results: 1) pre-registration and 2) registered reports. Pre-registration refers to the time-stamped (online) registration of hypotheses/research questions, research designs, data collection, and/or analyses prior to collecting or analysing the data. Registered reports are a new publication format whereby researchers submit their planned hypotheses/research questions, design, and analyses for peer review prior to data collection. Following peer review, journals may conditionally accept a paper regardless of the results if the authors follow through with the planned study. During the roundtable, experts will be invited to share their perspectives on these practices, as well as offer tips and guidance for researchers interested in adopting these practices. Stijn Ruiter (NSCR) will share his expertise on pre-registration, and Sandy Schumann (UCL) will share her expertise on registered reports. The roundtable is open to anyone who is interested in learning more about pre-registration and registered reports, as well as those with experience who would like to contribute to the discussion about implementing these in practice. This roundtable is organised by the European Network for Open Criminology. Chair: Amy Nivette, Utrecht University. Discussants: Sandy Schumann, University College London; and Stijn Ruiter, NSCR.\n4. Panel ‘Open Science in Criminology’\nFriday, September 13, 5:00 to 6:15pm, Faculty of Law, University of Bucharest, Floor: Ground floor, Room 1.04\nOpen science in criminology promotes integrity, collaboration, innovation, and societal impact, contributing to a more rigorous and inclusive approach to understanding and addressing crime-related phenomena. This panel presents reflections on advances and challenges related to open access, open data and open research partnerships with the goal to inspire the broader adaptation of open science principles within the discipline.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a copy of the article originally published in the Issue 21 of the ESC Newsletter\nOver the past fifteen years, the social and behavioural sciences have navigated a crisis of replicability. Many landmark studies cannot be reproduced, and their findings cannot be replicated, leaving the credibility of many established research areas in doubt. This crisis has many causes, but much can be attributed to the way in which research is incentivised and practised within universities. The pressure to ‘publish or perish’, gain citations, or attract media attention has resulted in researchers deploying a range of questionable strategies that yield attractive results but may not accurately reflect the phenomena they studied. Criminology faced a large-scale crisis of replicability in 2020, when Justin Pickett reported significant anomalies in a set of publications from Eric Stewart, formerly a Professor at Florida State University. As a result, six articles were retracted, and one was corrected. Some of these articles had been published in flagship journals such as ‘Criminology’, ‘Justice Quarterly’, ‘Social Problems’, and ‘Law & Society Review’.\nAn ever-growing group of researchers concerned with the crisis of replicability argue for the creation and development of new ways of working and new infrastructures that can, in part, restore the integrity of the social and behavioural sciences. These new ways of working affect every part of the research process - from the conception of ideas through to planning, data collection, analysis, and dissemination - but all have transparency and openness as guiding principles. Accordingly, this movement is known as ‘open research’, and it is increasingly an essential feature of high-quality research. If we are to ensure the future integrity of criminology, it is crucial that we accept the responsibility to embrace open research principles and practices.\nIn response to this challenge, 46 criminologists, based in 13 different countries, have founded the European Network for Open Criminology (ENOC). ENOC was launched as a working group of the European Society of Criminology in September 2023, in Florence, Italy. The newly created network will bring together European criminologists interested in Open Research, aiming to become one of the driving forces for the promotion, training, application, and rewarding of Open Research practices in criminology. ENOC fosters and encourages practices that embrace openness, integrity, and reproducibility throughout the research cycle. This includes the collaborative working and transparent sharing of research methodology (e.g., pre-registration), use and development of open access software, making analytic code and data freely available online, and publishing research outputs in open access - so anyone, from any part of the world, can view and download them without the need to log in or pay.\nThe primary goals of ENOC include sharing good practices in open research, raising awareness about the need for open criminology practices and development/training opportunities, and encouraging and promoting the use of open access repositories for academic publishing. ENOC also encourages and supports criminology journals to promote and reward open research practices and advocates for open research with funders, stakeholders, and research users.\n\n\n\nThe contents of this website is available for re-use under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This year’s British Society of Criminology conference was hosted at the University of Strathclyde’s campus in Glasgow, Scotland between 9th and 12th July. The conference opened with a one-day postgraduate researcher event that was attended by more than 80 researchers, which reflects the vibrancy of postgraduate research in criminology in the UK.\n\nThe opening workshop for the event was delivered by ENOC co-chair, Prof Iain Brennan, titled ‘Open Criminology’. In this session, Iain discussed many of the reasons why greater transparency would benefit the quality and integrity of research findings. He then introduced open research as a set of practices, including pre-registration, open data and open access that criminology researchers can adopt. He also emphasised how changes to the terms of funding agreements will soon make engagement with open research practices a mainstream activity. The workshop was followed by a lively discussion of what ‘openness’ means for criminology and for individual research projects, particularly with regard to making sensitive qualitative and quantitative data ‘open’ and within the parameters of postgraduate projects.\nReflecting on the workshop, Iain noted: “As the open research lead for my university, I introduce researchers from all sorts of disciplines to the concept of open research. It was wonderful to be able to discuss it in the context of my own discipline.”\n“The questions asked by attendees were extremely encouraging and it was heartening to see so many people nodding when I talked about open access as a tool for social justice and agreeing when I claimed there is a need for others to be able to reanalyse and reuse our data in a way that is as open as possible, but as closed as necessary.”\nIain shared links to the ENOC website and mailing list and in the days after the event, several researchers signed up to join ENOC. We welcome these new researchers to open criminology and look forward to their future open criminology activity.\nThe slides for this talk are below and are made available for reuse under a CC-BY 4.0 license.

    "text": "You’re a criminal-justice researcher and you’ve just published an article in a top journal. It was a lot of work: you spent months securing ethical approval, collecting data or negotiating access to secondary data, completing the analysis, writing up the results and responding to reviews. You are rightly proud of the result. But – by default and without meaning to – you have probably locked your paper away behind a journal paywall so that many potential readers simply can’t see it.\nWhile researchers at universities in western countries typically have electronic access to journals, many others who could benefit from criminal-justice research do not. Universities in developing countries may have very few library resources, while access to journals in police and local-government agencies is typically extremely limited, meaning the increasing band of criminal-justice pracademics (who want to make use of research and have the skills to do so) are often left in the dark.\nThe lack of public access to criminal-justice research is particularly worrying because so much of it is relevant to practitioners and policy makers. Imagine a police captain who wants to know what effects the introduction of body-worn cameras is likely to have, or who has to decide whether to authorize a a ‘scared straight’ program suggested by one of her officers. Not having access to good-quality research could easily lead to decisions that harm public safety or waste scarce resources.\nFortunately, you almost certainly have the right to release a version of your paper online for anyone to read, completely free. This is referred to as self-archiving or as green open access, to distinguish it from gold open access in which authors pay an article processing charge (APC) to make the article free on the journal website.\nAll the main publishers of criminology journals allow authors to post the pre-print or submitted version of an article (the version originally submitted to the journal) on authors’ personal and university websites, as well as specialist websites known as pre-print servers. Most publishers also allow authors to post the post-print or accepted version (the final version submitted to the journal after any revisions), although sometimes with more restrictions. As part of their open-access policies, publishers also do not consider self-archiving of pre- or post-prints as prior publication. There are other benefits to self-archiving, too: releasing a pre-print is associated with more attention and citations for the peer-reviewed article.\nEven though authors can release their articles online, recent research shows only about a quarter of articles in criminology journals are open access (either green or gold). This means that in the past three years, over 9,000 criminology articles that could have been open to the public were instead locked away.\nYou might be worried about releasing your article publicly before it has been peer reviewed. What if you’ve made a mistake? You can decide not to post the submitted version online, choosing instead to post the accepted version once it is available. But doing this means your research stays hidden during the review and revision process. If a practitioner needs to make a decision now about a policy or practice, they may prefer to have access to your research (perhaps with a note explaining it has not yet been reviewed) rather than have to make the decision blind, only to see your research released a few months later when it no longer matters to them. It’s also worth remembering that the peer-review process is not perfect. Many mistakes (and worse) have been published despite being read by multiple reviewers, so authors should not treat peer review as the only determinant of research quality. I post both the submitted and accepted versions of my articles, trusting readers to understand that all research should be read critically.\nThe easiest way to discover your self-archiving rights under a particular journal policy is to search the Sherpa Romeo database, which summarizes policies from more than 4,000 publishers. Take the journal Policing, published by Oxford University Press. Searching on Sherpa Romeo shows:\n\nIn this case you can:\n\npost the submitted (pre-print) version on your own website, an ‘institutional repository’ (your university website) or a ‘subject repository’ (a pre-print server),\npost the accepted (post-print) version on your university website or a pre-print repository, but only 24 months after publication (known as an embargo period).\n\nIn both cases, once the article is published you must add a note to the pre-/post-print linking to the published version.\nWhen it comes to the question of where to post your paper, remember the objective is to get your research into the hands of those who need it. The more widely you distribute your article, the easier it will be for people to find. I post my papers on my own website, the institutional repository run by my university and a pre-print server called SocArXiv that hosts papers from across the social sciences. Other options include Academia.edu and ResearchGate, although there are reasons you might not want to use them. I use SocArXiv because it is indexed by search engines such as Google Scholar. SocArXiv (and some other pre-print servers) also assign a digital object identifier (DOI) to your article, making it easier for people to cite it even before the final version is published. Posting an article on a pre-print server is straightforward and usually takes only a few minutes.\nWhen posting your paper online, you will be asked to choose a license under which people can re-use it. By default, you own the copyright to any work you post online, but this may restrict others from using your paper by (for example) sending it to a mailing list or hosting a copy for students on their university online learning portal. You can make it easier for people to share your content with others by using an open license, which gives people re-use rights. For example, the Creative Commons Attribution License allows people to re-use your work for any purpose, as long as they cite you as the author.\nSelf archiving can be useful even if you intend to eventually publish your article using gold open access. Gold open access makes it very easy for readers to find an article, but it is only available to authors (or institutions) who can afford the high prices of APCs. Gold open access also keeps research hidden throughout the peer-review and publishing process. If you plan to make your article gold open access by paying an APC, consider also posting the pre-print version of the article at the time you submit to the journal. If you are a research leader, be it a doctoral adviser or a head of department, you can also encourage self-archiving by establishing it as the norm among your team.\nOpen-access publishing isn’t enough to ensure your article has an impact among practitioners. You can also present your work at practitioner conferences, publish summaries of the results in practitioner-focused magazines or websites, discuss your findings on social media or host a webinar. But self archiving to make your work available to practitioners and other readers who don’t have access to journal subscriptions is a great first step.\nThis post first appeared on the (now defunct) #CrimComm Blog\nThanks to Dr Lily Gleicher and Prof Peter Moskos for their comments on an earlier draft of this post.\n\n\n\nThe contents of this website is available for re-use under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence."
